## About

I design preventive digital risk systems focused on early detection of digital exposure, impersonation, fraud vectors and structural reputation risk.

My work centers on proactive cyber-risk modeling, digital footprint surface analysis and exposure correlation systems designed to prevent high-impact digital incidents before materialization.

I develop Influsafe® — a scientific-grade Digital Exposure & Identity Risk System designed to detect invisible risk structures across identity, reputation and digital attack surface layers.
