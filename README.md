## About

I design preventive digital risk engines focused on early detection of identity exposure, reputational attack vectors and latent structural vulnerabilities.

My work centers on proactive cyber–risk modeling, digital footprint surface analysis and pre-incident exposure detection systems.

I develop Influsafe — a scientific-grade digital exposure risk prevention framework registered at CERN / Zenodo.

### Influsafe — Digital Exposure Risk Engine

Scientific Software DOI: **10.5281/zenodo.18238918**

Preventive exposure detection framework designed to:

- Map active and passive digital footprint surfaces  
- Detect latent identity leaks and exposure vectors  
- Analyze reputational and structural attack surfaces  
- Correlate multi-source digital risk signals  
- Generate preventive exposure scoring before incidents occur
